# wav2vec-lfmmi

wav2vec-lfmmi provides recipes from fine-tuning a pre-trained [wav2vec 2.0 model](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/92d1e1eb1cd6f9fba3227870bb6d7f07-Paper.pdf) using the [espresso](https://github.com/freewym/espresso) tool kit. Right now, we provide the recipe for fine-tuning on Librispeech 100h subset. In the future, we will be adding the recipes for other datasets as well.

In the future, some of these will be merged with the [espresso](https://github.com/freewym/espresso) tool kit at which point we will update our README.
